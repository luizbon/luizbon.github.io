      <description>This year I worked as a volunteer at NDC Sydney, and since I was involved with it, I decided to write a Bot to help attendees find sessions.
The ChatBot started simple answering questions related to sessions and speakers. It returns an adaptive card with all information about each session.
Having all sessions wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, so I added integration with QnAMaker, just in case a user asks about something not related to the sessions.</description>
